#Resturant Data Analysis in Delhi NCR

</br>
Delhi is the capital city of India. It has huge population of around 19 million and area 1484 sqkm making itâ€™s population density to be 12803 people per square kilometers which makes Delhi to be among the list of densely populated cities of world.

Delhi has been cultural center from ancient times which lives upto its description till today. It was destroyed and rebuilt 7 times in history and each time the maker of city add his/her own cultural influence making the rich heritage even more diversified.

Food has been a major part of this cultural legacy. Diversity in food of Delhi is just mind numbing from Muglai to continental, north Indian to south Indian, food from each and every corner of world has graced the gastronomy of the city.

People of Delhi love food. Many restaurants pop up every month and more are shut down. The competition in restaurant industry is very intense. The place where restaurant is located plays huge role in its footfall. Theirs are certain preference of cuisines which people like. Also since population of city has grown so much many sub cities have grown around Delhi, collectively called as Delhi NCR. These sub cities further add to the competition in restaurant industry.

When we consider these challenges, we can create visualization to get information where the most of restaurants are located, which types of cusines are preferred , what is cost for 2 people etc. and give a broader picture to anyone who wish to open restaurant in city. Here I have assumed that input costing (raw material, rent, salary, etc. ) of every restaurant is same and has not taken it into consideration.
